# Assignment

1. Go to the shared.css file and add a media query. With this query you should achieve the following:

    a. The media query should be active for screens with a minimum width of 40rem
    b. The "toggle-button" should not be visible as soon as the media query is active
        Hint: We might have to improve the Navigation Bar height once the button disappears. Make sure to have a look at the ".main-header__brand" and ".main-header__brand img" selectors
    c. The "main-nav" elements should only be visible when the media query is active

2. Create another media query. The query should again become active once the screen width is equal or larger than 40rem

    a. The list items in the footer should be positioned below each other in the mobile and next to each other in the desktop view
    b. The list items in the footer should have a top/bottom margin of 1rem in the mobile and a left/right margin of 1rem in the desktop view
